## Known Bugs or Issues

No known issues.

## Experience

I used the examples from the book and renamed them. For the rest of the project I used AI. I had to change the main to have the preprocessor ignore it for testing. There was also a warning because of casting or some other such thing. I resolve these kind of issues with casting into larger data types or explicitly casting where possible.
